Description




1.NOTE

The MH-01 (2-in-1) model includes flow and TDS monitoring by default. It supports optional micro (1mm, 0.1 1L/min) or large bore (4mm, 0.3 3L/min) sizes, and can be configured with either integrated or split cable designs.
MH-01 (3-in-1) and MH-02 (3-in-1) models come with flow, TDS, and temperature sensing functions, using an integrated 6-wire cable only.
All models operate on DC 5 18V and offer ±3% flow detection accuracy. The standard MH-01 (2-in-1) does not include temperature sensing, but customization is available.
Some configurations may not be shown due to listing limitations. Please leave a note at checkout or contact us if you have specific requirements.
